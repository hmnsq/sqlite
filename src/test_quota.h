** This file contains the interface definition for the quota a VFS shim.
**
** This particular shim enforces a quota system on files.  One or more
** database files are in a "quota group" that is defined by a GLOB
** pattern.  A quota is set for the combined size of all files in the
** the group.  A quota of zero means "no limit".  If the total size
** of all files in the quota group is greater than the limit, then
** write requests that attempt to enlarge a file fail with SQLITE_FULL.
**
** However, before returning SQLITE_FULL, the write requests invoke
** a callback function that is configurable for each quota group.
** This callback has the opportunity to enlarge the quota.  If the
** callback does enlarge the quota such that the total size of all
** files within the group is less than the new quota, then the write
** continues as if nothing had happened.

/*
** Create or destroy a quota group.
**
** The quota group is defined by the zPattern.  When calling this routine
** with a zPattern for a quota group that already exists, this routine
** merely updates the iLimit, xCallback, and pArg values for that quota
** group.  If zPattern is new, then a new quota group is created.
**
** The zPattern is always compared against the full pathname of the file.
** Even if APIs are called with relative pathnames, SQLite converts the
** name to a full pathname before comparing it against zPattern.  zPattern
** is a glob pattern with the following matching rules:
**
**      '*'       Matches any sequence of zero or more characters.
**
**      '?'       Matches exactly one character.
**
**     [...]      Matches one character from the enclosed list of
**                characters.  "]" can be part of the list if it is
**                the first character.  Within the list "X-Y" matches
**                characters X or Y or any character in between the
**                two.  Ex:  "[0-9]" matches any digit.
**
**     [^...]     Matches one character not in the enclosed list.
**
**     /          Matches either / or \.  This allows glob patterns
**                containing / to work on both unix and windows.
**
** Note that, unlike unix shell globbing, the directory separator "/"
** can match a wildcard.  So, for example, the pattern "/abc/xyz/" "*"
** matches any files anywhere in the directory hierarchy beneath
** /abc/xyz.
**
** The glob algorithm works on bytes.  Multi-byte UTF8 characters are
** matched as if each byte were a separate character.
**
** If the iLimit for a quota group is set to zero, then the quota group
** is disabled and will be deleted when the last database connection using
** the quota group is closed.
**
** Calling this routine on a zPattern that does not exist and with a
** zero iLimit is a no-op.
**
** A quota group must exist with a non-zero iLimit prior to opening
** database connections if those connections are to participate in the
** quota group.  Creating a quota group does not affect database connections
** that are already open.
**
** The patterns that define the various quota groups should be distinct.
** If the same filename matches more than one quota group pattern, then
** the behavior of this package is undefined.
