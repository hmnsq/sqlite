/*
** Deferred and Immediate FKs
** --------------------------
**
** Foreign keys in SQLite come in two flavours: deferred and immediate.
** If an immediate foreign key constraint is violated,
** SQLITE_CONSTRAINT_FOREIGNKEY is returned and the current
** statement transaction rolled back. If a 
** deferred foreign key constraint is violated, no action is taken 
** immediately. However if the application attempts to commit the 
** transaction before fixing the constraint violation, the attempt fails.
**
** Deferred constraints are implemented using a simple counter associated
** with the database handle. The counter is set to zero each time a 
** database transaction is opened. Each time a statement is executed 
** that causes a foreign key violation, the counter is incremented. Each
** time a statement is executed that removes an existing violation from
** the database, the counter is decremented. When the transaction is
** committed, the commit fails if the current value of the counter is
** greater than zero. This scheme has two big drawbacks:
**
**   * When a commit fails due to a deferred foreign key constraint, 
**     there is no way to tell which foreign constraint is not satisfied,
**     or which row it is not satisfied for.
**
**   * If the database contains foreign key violations when the 
**     transaction is opened, this may cause the mechanism to malfunction.
**
** Despite these problems, this approach is adopted as it seems simpler
** than the alternatives.
**
** INSERT operations:
**
**   I.1) For each FK for which the table is the child table, search
**        the parent table for a match. If none is found increment the
**        constraint counter.
**
**   I.2) For each FK for which the table is the parent table, 
**        search the child table for rows that correspond to the new
**        row in the parent table. Decrement the counter for each row
**        found (as the constraint is now satisfied).
**
** DELETE operations:
**
**   D.1) For each FK for which the table is the child table, 
**        search the parent table for a row that corresponds to the 
**        deleted row in the child table. If such a row is not found, 
**        decrement the counter.
**
**   D.2) For each FK for which the table is the parent table, search 
**        the child table for rows that correspond to the deleted row 
**        in the parent table. For each found increment the counter.
**
** UPDATE operations:
**
**   An UPDATE command requires that all 4 steps above are taken, but only
**   for FK constraints for which the affected columns are actually 
**   modified (values must be compared at runtime).
**
** Note that I.1 and D.1 are very similar operations, as are I.2 and D.2.
** This simplifies the implementation a bit.
**
** For the purposes of immediate FK constraints, the OR REPLACE conflict
** resolution is considered to delete rows before the new row is inserted.
** If a delete caused by OR REPLACE violates an FK constraint, an exception
** is thrown, even if the FK constraint would be satisfied after the new 
** row is inserted.
**
** Immediate constraints are usually handled similarly. The only difference 
** is that the counter used is stored as part of each individual statement
** object (struct Vdbe). If, after the statement has run, its immediate
** constraint counter is greater than zero,
** it returns SQLITE_CONSTRAINT_FOREIGNKEY
** and the statement transaction is rolled back. An exception is an INSERT
** statement that inserts a single row only (no triggers). In this case,
** instead of using a counter, an exception is thrown immediately if the
** INSERT violates a foreign key constraint. This is necessary as such
** an INSERT does not open a statement transaction.
**
** TODO: How should dropping a table be handled? How should renaming a 
** table be handled?
**
**
** Query API Notes
** ---------------
**
** Before coding an UPDATE or DELETE row operation, the code-generator
** for those two operations needs to know whether or not the operation
** requires any FK processing and, if so, which columns of the original
** row are required by the FK processing VDBE code (i.e. if FKs were
** implemented using triggers, which of the old.* columns would be 
** accessed). No information is required by the code-generator before
** coding an INSERT operation. The functions used by the UPDATE/DELETE
** generation code to query for this information are:
**
**   sqlite3FkRequired() - Test to see if FK processing is required.
**   sqlite3FkOldmask()  - Query for the set of required old.* columns.
**
**
** Externally accessible module functions
** --------------------------------------
**
**   sqlite3FkCheck()    - Check for foreign key violations.
**   sqlite3FkActions()  - Code triggers for ON UPDATE/ON DELETE actions.
**   sqlite3FkDelete()   - Delete an FKey structure.
*/

/*
** VDBE Calling Convention
** -----------------------
**
** Example:
**
**   For the following INSERT statement:
**
**     CREATE TABLE t1(a, b INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, c);
**     INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(1, 2, 3.1);
**
**   Register (x):        2    (type integer)
**   Register (x+1):      1    (type integer)
**   Register (x+2):      NULL (type NULL)
**   Register (x+3):      3.1  (type real)
*/

/*
** A foreign key constraint requires that the key columns in the parent
** table are collectively subject to a UNIQUE or PRIMARY KEY constraint.
** Given that pParent is the parent table for foreign key constraint pFKey, 
** search the schema for a unique index on the parent key columns. 
**
** If successful, zero is returned. If the parent key is an INTEGER PRIMARY 
** KEY column, then output variable *ppIdx is set to NULL. Otherwise, *ppIdx 
** is set to point to the unique index. 
** 
** If the parent key consists of a single column (the foreign key constraint
** is not a composite foreign key), output variable *paiCol is set to NULL.
** Otherwise, it is set to point to an allocated array of size N, where
** N is the number of columns in the parent key. The first element of the
** array is the index of the child table column that is mapped by the FK
** constraint to the parent table column stored in the left-most column
** of index *ppIdx. The second element of the array is the index of the
** child table column that corresponds to the second left-most column of
** *ppIdx, and so on.
**
** If the required index cannot be found, either because:
**
**   1) The named parent key columns do not exist, or
**
**   2) The named parent key columns do exist, but are not subject to a
**      UNIQUE or PRIMARY KEY constraint, or
**
**   3) No parent key columns were provided explicitly as part of the
**      foreign key definition, and the parent table does not have a
**      PRIMARY KEY, or
**
**   4) No parent key columns were provided explicitly as part of the
**      foreign key definition, and the PRIMARY KEY of the parent table 
**      consists of a different number of columns to the child key in 
**      the child table.
**
** then non-zero is returned, and a "foreign key mismatch" error loaded
** into pParse. If an OOM error occurs, non-zero is returned and the
** pParse->db->mallocFailed flag is set.
